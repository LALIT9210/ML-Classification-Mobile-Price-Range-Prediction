# ML-Classification-Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction
The goal of the mobile price range prediction project is to create reliable prediction models that use machine learning techniques to estimate the price range of mobile devices based on their features and specifications. Data collection, preprocessing, model training and assessment, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection are all part of this process. The project's ultimate purpose is to provide significant insights and forecasts that can assist in educated pricing and marketing decisions in the competitive mobile device industry.

Important data about mobile devices, such as brand, model, display size, camera specs, CPU, storage, RAM, battery capacity, user reviews, and other pertinent information, is gathered to begin the project. This data is then preprocessed to handle missing values, feature engineering, as well as data normalization.

Using the preprocessed data, several machine learning methods, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVM), are then trained and evaluated. Accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and cross-validation are among the evaluation measures used for these models.

Hyperparameter tuning approaches may also be used to improve model performance by determining the best values for hyperparameters such as learning rate, regularisation strength, maximum tree depth, number of neighbors in KNN, and kernel type in SVM.

In conclusion, the mobile price range prediction problem is a typical machine learning classification task where the goal is to predict the price range of mobile devices based on certain features. In this project, various machine learning classification models were trained and evaluated using a labeled dataset of mobile device features and corresponding price ranges.

After analyzing the data, conducting feature engineering, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, multiple classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were trained and evaluated. Performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess the performance of the models.

the mobile price range prediction project involved the development and evaluation of machine learning classification models using a labeled dataset of mobile device features. The project highlighted the importance of feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation in achieving good performance. The results of this project can be utilized by businesses, mobile device manufacturers, and retailers to predict and optimize mobile prices, offer competitive pricing, and make informed business decisions. Further research and experimentation with different models, feature engineering techniques, and hyperparameter tuning approaches could be explored to enhance the predictive accuracy of the models and provide more valuable insights for the mobile device industry.
